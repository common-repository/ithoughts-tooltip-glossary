# iThoughts WordPress Plugin Toolbox

The files present in this package are intended to provide a coherent core across all iThoughts plugins. The Backbone class is the core of the plugin, which handles options (lazy loaded), paths, etc etc.
The toolbox is not handled with versions, but with revisions
Every class is namespaced with its own version namespace to avoid collisions between versions.

Feel free to upgrade it.
